## Problem

Components often own the external spacing surrounding themselves. However, in doing so, it limits the components' capability to be re-used. Spacing around a component is most often directly related to the context in which the component is used. Create an abstraction that is responsible for providing (even) spacing between a group of components.

## Spacing

- [x] Given a spacing value, when rendering a group of components horizontally, then components are rendered with the predfined amount of space between each one.
- [x] Given a spacing value, when rendering a group of components vertically, then components are rendered with the predfined amount of space between each one.
- [x] Given a spacing value and no units, when rendering a group of components, then the spacing unit is pixels.
- [x] Given a spacing value and a unit of measurement, when rendering a group of components, then the spacing unit is the same as the units provided.
- [x] Given a spacing value, when rendering a group of components, then there is the spacing value's amount of space before the first component.
- [x] Given a spacing value, when rendering a group of components, then there is the spacing value's amount of space after the last component.

<div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spacing={16}>
            <div>horizontal</div>
            <span>horizontal</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spacing={16} direction={Direction.vertical}>
            <div>vertical</div>
            <span>vertical</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spacing={3} unit="rem">
            <div>horizontal</div>
            <span>horizontal</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spacing={3} direction={Direction.vertical} unit="rem">
            <div>vertical</div>
            <span>vertical</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
</div>

## No Gutters

- [x] Given no gutters are to be rendered, when rendering a group of components horizontally, then there is no spacing to the left the first component
- [x] Given no gutters are to be rendered, when rendering a group of components vertically, then there is no spacing to the top the first component
- [x] Given no gutters are to be rendered, when rendering a group of components horizontally, then there is no spacing to the right the last component
- [x] Given no gutters are to be rendered, when rendering a group of components vertically, then there is no spacing to the bottom the last component

<div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup noGutters spacing={16}>
            <div>no</div>
            <span>gutters</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup noGutters spacing={16} direction={Direction.vertical}>
            <div>no</div>
            <span>gutters</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
</div>

## Spread

- [x] Given the group is spread, when rendering a group of components horizontally, then the components are equally spaced within the width of their container
- [x] Given group is spread, when rendering a group of components vertically, then the components are equally spaced within the height of their container

<div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spread spacing={16}>
            <div>spread</div>
            <span>spread</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black', height: '300px'}}>
        <SpacedGroup spread spacing={16} direction={Direction.vertical}>
            <div>spread</div>
            <span>spread</span>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
</div>

## Centered

- [x] Given the group is centered, when rendering the group of components horizontally, then the components are horizontally centered within their parent
- [x] Given the group is centered, when rendering the group of components vertically, then the components are vertically centered within their parent

<div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup centered spacing={16}>
            <div style={{lineHeight: '50px'}}>no</div>
            <span>gutters</span>
                <div style={{height: '35px', background: 'cyan', width: '35px'}}></div>
                <div style={{height: '5px', background: 'cyan', width: '5px'}}></div>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
    <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
        <SpacedGroup centered spacing={16} direction={Direction.vertical}>
            <div>no</div>
            <span>gutters</span>
                <div style={{height: '35px', background: 'cyan', width: '35px'}}></div>
                <div style={{height: '5px', background: 'cyan', width: '5px'}}></div>
        </SpacedGroup>
    </div>
</div>

## Changing Root Component

- [x] Given a React component to be used as the root element, when rendering the group of components, the root component is rendered as the provided component.

<SpacedGroup as="span" direction={Direction.vertical} spacing={16}>
    <span>hello</span>
    <span>world</span>
</SpacedGroup>
