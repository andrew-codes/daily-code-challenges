### Problem

Create a component to showcase code katas. The intention is to use the component on the landing page to list katas and drill down into their details.

- [x] When I view the root route `/`, then the component should display the code kata's name and completion date.
- [x] When I view the root route, then the component provides a link in which I can view additional information about the code kata.
- [x] Given I am on the root route, when I click a code kata's link, then it takes me to a new route specific to the chosen code kata.
- [x] When viewing the code kata's details route/view, then I can view the code kata's README file contents.
- [x] When viewing the code kata's details route/view, then I can view a demo of the code kata.
- [x] Given I have a kata's README in markdown, when I view the kata's details, then I can read the README as formatted rich text
